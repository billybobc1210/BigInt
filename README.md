This is a class for encapsulating arbitrarily large integers and providing the ability to perform 
mathematical operations on them like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo arithmetic, 
absolute value and negation, etc. Essentially, it does what Java's built-in BigInteger class does.  

Of course, BigInteger does it much more efficiently using sophisticated bitwise operations, so the purpose of this 
project is not to try to do it better but is rather just intended to be an interesting exercise in how these same 
operations could be accomplished by emulating in software how we learned to do these operations in grade school.
